            I liked drawing but never took any class, except the mandatory ones at school. I never really felt like a
            legitimate artist for that, because "all" I would do is copy references in my own hand. I still do to this
            day but I also draw my own drawings.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started digital drawing in the spring of 2025, when I decided I wanted to make a comic of my friends,
            talking about the year we had together and all the funny things we said. Then, I continued drawing, simple
            as that.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've done drawings for friends and people that are very close to me. I've done drawings to help get out my
            feelings and help make sense of my brain. I've drawn to learn, and to show. I hope I'll draw until I can't
            hold a pencil, because it brings me a lot of joy.

            Currently, I have put my creativity and hands into use for <a class="text_link" href="agepoly.ch">Agepoly
            </a>, the student association at my engineering school. Of course, every asset of this website is drawn by 
            me!
